# Kaggle-Blood-Cell-Images

Data are presented are downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells. The detail discriptions are in the kaggle page. There are 12,515 training images, each 320 x 240 pixels in size, while there are 2,487 testing images in the same size. These datasets are augmented images of blood cells from 4 different cell types which are Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. 

With implementation of Keras and TensorFlow on AWS Deep Learning AMI, I tried with multiple neural network data structures and convolution neural network data structures.
