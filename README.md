# Kaggle-Blood-Cell-Images

Data are presented are downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells. The detail discriptions are in the kaggle page. There are 12,515 training images, each 320 x 240 pixels in size, while there are 2,487 testing images in the same size. These datasets are augmented images of blood cells from 4 different cell types which are Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. 

With implementation of Keras and TensorFlow on AWS Deep Learning AMI, I tried with multiple neural network data structures and convolution neural network data structures. The configurations of architectures are shown in the .xlsx file with all the compute metrics (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, etc.).  Detail result for each run and each epoch are shown in the output txt file in the repository.
